- **Streamlit**: This application is built using Streamlit, a powerful framework for creating data-centric web applications with simple Python scripts.

- **Weaviate (Vector Database)**: The semantic search functionality is powered by Weaviate, a vector database that enables efficient storage and retrieval of vectorized data.

- **Sentence Transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)**: This model is used to convert textual data into numerical vectors, facilitating semantic similarity calculations. It plays a crucial role in enabling effective semantic search capabilities within the application.
